**Deliverable 4 Requirements**

- A metric to be tested is mentioned

Safety Feature Rating: Independent Variable
Current Price (Selling): Dependent Variable
Drive Package : Independent Variable
Engine (Electric, Hybrid, Gasoline / Conventional): Independent Variable
Resale Value: Independent Variable
Average Annual Cost of ownership (Maintenance): Independent Variable
MPG (Gasoline Efficiency): Independent Variable


- A null hypothesis or an alternative hypothesis is described

Null Hypothesis (Ho): MechaCar is priced correctly based on its performance of key factors for its genre.
Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): MechaCar is NOT priced correctly based on performance of key factors for its genre.


- A statistical test is described to test the hypothesis

A multiple linear regression would be used to determine the factors that have the highest correlation/predictability with the list selling price
